## Responsive GPT-3 Landing Page
### [Live Site](https://m-gpt-3.netlify.app/)

- This is my another project with React which I built from the scratch. 
- It's landing page about gpt-3, which is openAI.
- In this project I have learned how to use many css properties like grid, flex, overlay, hover effects and responsive design.
- With help of React implemented multiple components like footer, blog, features, header and possibility.
